A tool to integrate Windows Media Player 11 setup into your Windows XP setup source. 

* Credits to boooggy from RyanVM Forums (https://ryanvm.net/forum/) for doing the hard work of writing the INF files 
that actually told setup how to install the Windows Media Player 11 files. This application is just a mini-integrator
that pulls the files from the original Microsoft setup packages and applies them to the setup source according to the rules
that he worked hard to write. Cheers my old friend :-)
